The aim of this project is to delvelop a device with ARDUINO able to measure different quantities to keep control of a beehive and to transmit the data with 
LoRa module to another arduino (the idea is to transmit them to home and analyse them to know the status of the beehive).
We measured the following parameters of the beehive:
TEMPERATURE:
T1=CLUSTER of bees
T2=T2=LEFT or EST STOCKS
T3=RIGHT or OVEST STOCKS
T4=CLUSTER of bees (safety)
T5=OUTSIDE
HUMIDITY
DHT0=humidity inside the beehive
DHT1=humidity outside the beehive
PIR
Flux oh bees entering and exiting the beehive to have an idea of the activity
WEIGHT
Weight of the beehive

LoRa
transmits the data to a second arduino
