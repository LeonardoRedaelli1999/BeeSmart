The aim of the codes in this folder is to test if the device works. We tested the device with temperature and humidity without the implementation of LoRa, so
 we loaded the data in the SD. We used a battery to keep ARDUINO working and we've have left it for some days collecting data from a beehive.
The code in this folder are used to save the temperature and humidity data in the SD during this testing phase. There is also the code to read all the data 
from the SD itself
